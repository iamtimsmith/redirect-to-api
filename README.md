# redirect-to-api

This wordpress plugin allows users to enter in a list of redirects and then outputs them in an api endpoint. This allows users in WordPress to easily manage redirects when using WP as a headless CMS. The redirects can be found at `/wp-json/redirects/v1/all` for simple consumption.
